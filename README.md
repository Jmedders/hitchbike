Hitchbike is a secure platform which allows travelers who need a bicycle to connect with
owners who have a spare bicycle to rent. As travelers who frequently visit foreign cities, we identified the need for reliable short-term transportation without having to pay the exorbitant fees of commercial bicycle rental companies. As bicycle-owners, we realized that our unused bicycles held value to someone who needed transportation.
